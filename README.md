# derived_adjective_events

This code is all related to my Capstone project for graduating the Brandeis Univeristy Computational Linguistics MS program. 

I am working with Dr. James Pustejovsky to determine what effect, if any, encoding event information into deverbal adjectives has on question answering. 

So far: 
* I have three groups of adjectives I am looking at: 
** 0-order derived adjectives: 'normal' root adjectives, that are not derived. Example: 'hard'
** 1st order derived adjectives: root verb adjectives; adjectives that are derived from verbs. Example: 'chopped' as in 'the chopped onions'
** 2nd order derived adjectives: derived root adjective; adjectives that are derived from verbs that were derived from adjectives. Example: 'hardened'
